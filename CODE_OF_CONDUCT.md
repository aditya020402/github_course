## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our
project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and
healthy environment.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or abusive language
- Personal attacks, trolling, or insulting comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,

reported to the project maintainers.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith
may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the community
leaders.
